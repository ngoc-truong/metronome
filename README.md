# Lindy Metronome

In this project I am going to build a metronome for swing dancing. The metronome should have 
a swing triplet rhythm feeling and the user should be able to decide which triplet counts should
be on or muted. Therefore, new rhythms can be created with this tool and incorperated into one's
own dance.

## Functionalities
- The user is able to turn the clicks on each count on/off
- The user is able to choose between a six-count and an eight-count rhythm
- The user should be able to increase or decrease the tempo
- Nice-to-have: The user is able to switch between a triplet and non-triplet rhythm
- Nice-to-have: Extend the functionality to have "normal" beats (e.g. 4/4).

## Technology used
- In order to practice, I used React (with Babel and Webpack) for the front-end.
